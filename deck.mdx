#### Introduction to

# Security Standards in the Cloud

## Secure delegated access with

# OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect


<Notes>

Goal: have an general understanding of the steps needed to authenticate users and manipulate their data from any cloud service.

We will concentrate on the Oauth 2.0 protocol and its identity layer OpenID Connect, their basic terminology and finally their authentication and authorization meachanisms.

# In the beginning...

import password from "./assets/password.jpg";

<img src={password} width="30%" />

<Notes>

In the beginning there were passwords to protect resources.

</Notes>

---

# Later on...

import computer from "./assets/computer.svg";

<img src={computer} width="20%" />

<Notes>

With computers, we naturally applied the same concept to apps and machines.

Passwords stored locally would be used to authenticate users.

</Notes>

---

# The Internet!

import domain from "./assets/domain.svg";

<img src={domain} width="40%" />

<Notes>

With the Internet, we realized that letting applications and machines handle authentication on their own was a bad idea.

- lots of duplicated user profiles!

The first authentication protocols appeared, such as Kerberos.

- The problem with these protocols was that authentication was centralized on domain controllers.
- Users, apps and services needed to be under the same organization.

</Notes>

# At last, SAML

import saml from "./assets/saml.svg";

<img src={saml} width="60%" />

<Notes>

In 2001, big IT players assembled a committee to solve the problem. The solution was SAML

With SAML, a user that belonged to company A could consume a service on company B in a reliable way and without requiring companies to duplicate user profile

The protocol was conceived in a way that enabled the service provider (company B in this
case) to validate the user identity on the fly

Problem with SAML is that it is heavily based on XML, verbose and fragile (changing order of nodes would invalidate tokens)

It ended up being used in the business world. Very powerful but kinda too big for the purpose in the consumer world.

import oauth2 from "./assets/oauth.png";

<img src={oauth2} width="20%" />

<Notes>

The OAuth protocol (2007) and OAuth 2.0 (2010) are standards created specifically to handle delegated authorization scenarios, like when you let a random application post something on Twitter as if it was you.

Essentially, OAuth 2.0 provides users with the ability to grant third-party access to web resources without sharing a password, aka authorization in the cloud with consent.

However, it got so much traction that developers started using it to do things it was not created to do, like handling end-user authentication.

</Notes>

---

import openidconnect from "./assets/openidconnect.png";

<img src={openidconnect} width="20%" />

<Notes>
OpenID Connect is a concrete standard protocol for authenticating end users derived on top of the oAuth 2.0 protocol. As such is also called a profile of OAuth 2.0. There are others.

It extends OAuth 2.0 by providing an identity layer for authentication. It's tiny, adds some 5-10% the the OAuth flows.

It allows cloud based applications to retrieve identity information along with details about the authentication event.

Enables SSO for mobile and web based apps.

</Notes>

---

#### How OAuth 2.0 works

# from passwords to tokens

<Notes>
  
In general, in our context, a token is an object that represents something else, such as another object (either physical or virtual).

OAuth makes use of tokens to work. It's different from actual credentials.

  </Notes>

---

# Authentication vs. Authorization

<Notes>

Authentication is the process of confirming the identity of an entity (e.g., a user)

An authentication process usually relies on some form of proof.

For example, if you go to the bank and try to withdraw money from your account, the clerk might ask you for an ID (an official document) to check who you are.

In contrast, authorization refers to the process of verifying what entities can access, or what actions they can perform.

In OAuth, for example, an access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.

</Notes>

---

import tickets from "./assets/tickets.png";

<img src={tickets} width="50%" />

<Notes>

For a concrete example, imagine a situation where some people get tickets for a concert.

In this case, the establishment will not be interested in their identity (i.e., on who they are).

What they care about is whether these people are authorized or not to attend the show.

To prove that they have the right to be there, instead of using an ID or a passport, they would use a ticket that contains no information about you.

</Notes>

---

import oauth2slide from "./assets/oauth2_slide.jpg";

<img src={oauth2slide} width="100%" />

<Notes>
OAuth uses the REST architectural style and JSON to request and retrieve tokens to grant access to cloud resources.

It can securely issue and validate them.

</Notes>

---

# OAuth 2.0 Roles

import oauth_participants_roles from "./assets/oauth_participants_roles.svg";

<img src={oauth_participants_roles} width="100%" />

<Notes>

Participants, or roles, in OAuth:

- The Resource Owner, or user. Who owns the data.

- The Client application. Who wants to manipulate the user data. Eg. a web or mobile app.

- The Authorization Server issues access tokens to the Client app, which are used to request access to the user data.

- The Resource Server retrieves the user data, if the owner authorizes it.

</Notes>

---

import oauthflow1 from "./assets/oauthflow1.svg";

<img src={oauthflow1} width="50%" />

<Notes>

This is roughly what happen for the Client App to obtain an access token and to be able to access a protected resource, such an API endpoint, a particular address etc.

In order to obtain this access token, the Client needs to present a valid grant type to the authorization server.

Also refered to as flows, the participants interact through them.

</Notes>

---

# Grant Types

import grant_types from "./assets/grant_types.png";

<img src={grant_types} width="50%" />

<Notes>

The most common ones are Authorization code and implicit. Widely used for web and mobile apps.

They are both called redirect flows, because they operate through Redirect URLs (302).

</Notes>

# The Authorization Code Flow, 1 of 5

Client prepares and sends an Authentication Request

<Highlighter language="http" customStyle={{background: '#d8d6d6'}}>{`HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://auth.server.co.uk/authorize?
          response_type=code
          &scope=myapi-read myapi-write bananas
          &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
          &state=bunnies
          &redirect_uri=http://client.example.org/cb
`}</Highlighter>

<Notes>

The client initiates the code flow by redirecting the browser to the authorisation server with an authorisation request.

The authorisation request parameters are encoded in the URI query:

- response_type: set to code to indicate an authorisation code flow.

- scope: specifies the scope of the requested token. Scopes are identifiers used to specify what access privileges are being requested. 

- client_id: the identifier of the client at the authorisation server. This identifier is assigned when the client is registered with the authorisation server.

- state: optional opaque value set by the client to maintain state between request and callback.

- redirect_uri: the client callback URI for the authorisation response.

</Notes>

---

import login_consent from "./assets/login_consent.png";

# The Authorization Code Flow, 2 of 5

Authorization Server Authenticates the End-User and obtains consent

<img src={login_consent} width="50%" />

<Notes>

At the authorisation server, the user will typically be authenticated, by checking if they have a valid session (established by a browser cookie),

and in the absence of that, by prompting the user to login.

After that, the server will determine if the client is to be authorised or not, by asking the user for their consent, by applying a rule or policy, or by some other mean.

</Notes>

---

# The Authorization Code Flow, 3 of 5

Authorization Server sends back to the Client with an Authorization Code

<Highlighter language="http" customStyle={{background: '#d8d6d6'}}>{`HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.example.org/cb?
          code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
          &state=bunnies`}</Highlighter>

<Notes>
    
The authorisation server will then call the client redirect_uri with 

an authorisation code (on success) 

or an error code (if access was denied, or some other error occurred, such a malformed request was detected).

The client should validate the state parameter, and use the code to proceed to the next step - exchanging the code for the access token.

The authorisation code is an intermediate credential, which encodes the authorisation we just obtained. 

It is therefore opaque to the client and only has meaning to the authorisation server. 

</Notes>

---

# The Authorization Code Flow, 4 of 5

Client requests a response using the Authorization Code at the Tokenn Endpoint

<Highlighter language="http" customStyle={{background: '#d8d6d6'}}>{`POST /token HTTP/1.1
    Host: auth.server.co.uk
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
    grant_type=authorization_code
    &code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &redirect_uri=https://client.example.org/cb`}</Highlighter>

<Notes>

To retrieve the access token the client must submit the code to the authorisation server, but this time with a direct back-channel request. 

The front-channel is the browser, less secure.

The back-channel is communication directly between the application and the IDP/OP.

This is done for two reasons:

- To authenticate confidential clients with the authorisation server before revealing the token

- To deliver the token straight to the client, thus avoid exposing it to the browser.

The code-for-token exchange happens at the token endpoint of the authorisation server:

</Notes>

---

# The Authorization Code Flow, 5 of 5

<ul>
    <li>Client receives a response that contains an Access Token in the response body</li>

<Highlighter language="http" customStyle={{background: '#d8d6d6'}}>{`HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
{
  "access_token" : "SlAV32hkKG",
  "token_type"   : "Bearer",
  "expires_in"   : 3600,
  "scope"        : "myapi-read myapi-write"
}`}</Highlighter>

</ul>

<Notes>
On success the authorisation server will return a JSON String with the issued access token:

The expires_in parameter informs the client for how many seconds the access token will be valid. 

The scope parameter what powers the token actually has, as some of the originally requested scope values may have been denied or others, not-explicitly requested, granted.

The JSON String can include an optional refresh token, which lets the client obtain a new access token from the authorisation server without having to repeat the code flow.

The mode this response is returned vary, JSON String, query parameters, fragment, post. Eg, `response_mode=form_post`, maybe more secure.

</Notes>

---

# Finally:

<Highlighter language="http" customStyle={{background: '#d8d6d6'}}>{`GET /resource/v1 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Authorization: Bearer SlAV32hkKG`}</Highlighter>

<Notes>

The access tokens in OAuth 2.0 are commonly of type bearer, meaning the client just needs to pass the token with each request. The HTTP Authorization header is the recommended method.

If the resource server determines the token to be valid and not expired, it will proceed with servicing the request.

Else, it will return an appropriate error in a HTTP WWW-Authenticate response header.

# OpenID Connect


---

# New words, same concepts

import op_rp from "./assets/op_rp.svg";

<img src={op_rp} width="50%" />

<Notes>

OpenID Connect Provider (OP): OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server that is capable of authenticating the end-user and providing claims to a Relying Party about the authentication event and the end-user.

Relying Party (RP): OAuth 2.0 Client application that requires end-user authentication and claims from an OpenID Connect Provider.

Entity: Something that has a separate and distinct existence and that can be identified in a context. An end-user is one example of an entity.

</Notes>

---

# Claims and Scope

<Notes>

Scopes are identifiers used to specify what access privileges are being requested. 

Scope we saw it already in OAuth 2.0, where we used it to define some domain specific identifiers.

Claims are name/value pairs that contain information about a user.

</Notes>

---

# Default scopes and claims

import claims_scope from "./assets/scope_claims.png";

<img src={claims_scope} width="40%" />

<Notes>

OpenID Connect specifies a set of standard claims, or user attributes. They are intended to supply the client with consented user details such as email, name and picture, upon request. 

Clients can request claims in two ways:

- an entire claims category by its scope value (see the mappings in the image)

- individually, with the optional claims request parameter.

<Notes>

The ID token resembles the concept of an identity card, in a standard JWT format, signed by the OpenID Provider (OP). 

To obtain one the client needs to send the user to their OP with an authentication request.

Features of the ID token:

- Asserts the identity of the user, called subject in OpenID (sub).
- Specifies the issuing authority (iss).
- Is generated for a particular audience, i.e. client (aud).
- May contain a nonce (nonce).
- May specify when (auth_time) and how, in terms of strength (acr), the user was authenticated.
- Has an issue (iat) and expiration time (exp).
- May include additional requested details about the subject, such as name and email address.
- Is digitally signed, so it can be verified by the intended recipients.
- May optionally be encrypted for confidentiality.
